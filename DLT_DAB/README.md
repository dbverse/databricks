Databricks Asset Bundle & DLT Pipeline Setup Summary
This document outlines the steps we've taken to set up a Databricks Asset Bundle (DAB) for deploying a Delta Live Tables (DLT) pipeline, focusing on a Raw data ingestion layer with partitioning.

1. Project Structure
We established a standard project structure for your Databricks Asset Bundle:

The DAB/ folder serves as the root directory for your bundle.

Inside DAB/, you'll find the databricks.yaml file, which is the core configuration for your pipeline and deployment.

A src/ subdirectory within DAB/ is where your DLT pipeline code resides.

Specifically, your DLT pipeline is now a Databricks notebook file located at src/retail_raw_dlt_pipeline.ipynb.

2. Databricks Asset Bundle (DAB) Configuration (databricks.yaml)
We've refined your databricks.yaml file to accurately define and deploy your serverless DLT pipeline:

Pipeline Definition: We set up the retail_raw_ingestion_pipeline as a DLT pipeline.

Source Specification: We correctly pointed the pipeline's libraries to your DLT notebook file (src/retail_raw_dlt_pipeline.ipynb), ensuring the bundle knows where to find your pipeline code.

Unity Catalog Integration: We explicitly set the catalog to users, directing DLT to publish tables into your personal Unity Catalog for development.

Serverless Compute: We enabled serverless: true for the pipeline, allowing Databricks to automatically manage the compute resources without needing to define a clusters block. We also ensured photon: true is set for optimal performance with serverless.

Pipeline Mode: The pipeline is configured for continuous: false (batch processing) and development: true for development purposes.

Job Trigger: A Databricks Job named run_retail_dlt_job was defined, with a task specifically designed to trigger your DLT pipeline.

Schedule Removal: We removed the schedule block from the job, meaning the pipeline will only run when manually triggered, not on an automated schedule.

Workspace Host: Your Databricks workspace URL is configured under the dev target.

3. Delta Live Tables (DLT) Pipeline Code (retail_raw_dlt_pipeline.ipynb)
Your DLT pipeline notebook is structured to implement the Raw layer of your medallion architecture:

Raw Table Definitions: It defines three raw tables: raw_orders, raw_customers, and raw_products using the @dlt.table decorator. These are the tables DLT will create and manage in your Unity Catalog.

Unity Catalog Volume Ingestion: Data sources for all raw tables are correctly linked to your Unity Catalog Volume paths.

Explicit Schemas: To prevent issues with empty or malformed input files and errors related to the _corrupt_record column in Unity Catalog, we introduced explicit schemas for raw_orders, raw_customers, and raw_products. This ensures Spark knows the expected data structure even if the raw data is imperfect.

Dynamic Partitioning: For raw_orders, the pipeline dynamically extracts a file_date from the source filenames (_metadata.file_path). This logic handles both daily files (e.g., orders_YYYY_MM_DD.json) and monthly full loads (e.g., monthly_full_load_YYYY_MM.json), ensuring monthly files are assigned a consistent YYYY-MM-01 date for partitioning. This partitioning is applied by DLT automatically based on the file_date column's presence.

Commented Layers: The Conformed and Curated layers of the pipeline are commented out, allowing you to focus on the Raw layer for initial setup.

4. Troubleshooting and Resolutions
Throughout this process, we addressed several key issues:

Databricks CLI Version: We resolved the "No such command 'bundle'" error by confirming the necessity of Databricks CLI version 0.200.0 or higher. We discussed installing/upgrading it, potentially by manually removing older executables and reinstalling via pip or brew within WSL.

databricks.yaml Warnings & Errors:

Removed storage_location as DLT handles it for Unity Catalog.

Corrected the libraries syntax for DLT pipelines, moving from file: to notebook: path: as appropriate for .ipynb files.

Removed the redundant clusters block when serverless: true is enabled to avoid conflicts.

DLT Pipeline TypeError (partition_by): Rectified the TypeError by removing the partition_by argument directly from the @dlt.table decorator, as DLT infers partitioning from the data or uses specific Delta table properties.

Unity Catalog AnalysisException (input_file_name / _corrupt_record): Addressed this by:

Replacing F.input_file_name() with F.col("_metadata.file_path"), which is the correct Unity Catalog-compatible method for retrieving file paths.

Implementing explicit schemas for all raw JSON tables (raw_orders, raw_customers, raw_products) to prevent schema inference issues with empty or corrupt files.
